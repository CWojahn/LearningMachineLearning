# Learning Machine Learning

Well, who never thought about studying machine learning? So this is my repository from all I'm learning about. Somethings that you have to now:

  - I'm an enthusiast, so you have to study and not use everything you see here as a law.
  - This is based on the video from [O Computeiro] - Fazendo uma Rede Neural do Zero! #1 - FeedForward;

### Techs that we will use!


* [Js] - Javascript!
* [P5js] - An awesome canvas drawing for js

### Installation

We need to install the P5js complete version library. So go to https://p5js.org/download/ and download it, then extract those files on the project folder.
